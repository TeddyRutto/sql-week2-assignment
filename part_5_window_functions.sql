-1)Write a query using ROW_NUMBER() to assign a unique rank to each exam result, ordered from highest mark to lowest. Show result_id, student_id, marks, and row_num.

select result_id, student_id, marks, row_number() over (order by marks desc) as row_num
from exam_results;

--2)Write a query using RANK() and DENSE_RANK() on exam results ordered by marks descending. Show both columns side by side so the difference between them is visible

select marks,
rank() over (order by marks desc) as rank_marks,
dense_rank() over (order by marks desc)as denserank_marks
from exam_results;

--3)Write a query using NTILE(3) to divide all exam results into 3 performance bands (1 = top, 2 = middle, 3 = bottom). Show result_id, marks, and band.

select result_id, marks,
case ntile(3) over (order by marks desc)
when 1 then'top'  
when 2 then 'middle' 
when 3 then 'bottom'
end as band
from exam_results;

--4)Write a query using AVG() OVER(PARTITION BY student_id) to show each exam result alongside that student's personal average mark. Show student_id, marks, and student_avg rounded to 2 decimal places.

select student_id, marks,
round(avg(marks) over (partition by student_id order by marks desc), 2) as student_avg
from exam_results;

--5)Write a query using LAG() to show each exam result alongside the previous result's marks for the same student. Also calculate the improvement (current marks minus previous marks). Use PARTITION BY student_id.

select student_id, marks, lag(marks) over(partition by student_id) as previous_marks, marks-lag(marks) over(partition by student_id) as improvement
from exam_results;
